This project is only compatible with hyperapp v1, and I do not intend to maintain it any longer. Hence, I am archiving it.

In [Hyperapp](https://hyperapp.js.org), the way to provide data to components is by passing properties to them. If your component tree is deep, and finely separated, this can quickly become repetetitive and burdensome -- and may lead to hard-to-find bugs.

"Contexts" offer a *complementary* (not exclusive) way of providing data to components which can remedy the situation.

This "higher-order-app" (or app decorator) enables the use of context in Hyperapp-apps.

## Installation

If you're using a module bundler, install With npm or Yarn:

<pre>
npm i <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperapp-context>hyperapp-context</a>
</pre>

And then import the same way you would anything else, in the same file where you import `app` from Hyperapp

```js
import {h, app as _app} from "hyperapp"
import context from "hyperapp-context"
```

Alternatively, if you're not using a module bunder, you can download hyperapp-context from a CDN like [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/hyperapp-context) and it will be globally available as <samp>window.context</samp>.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/hyperapp"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/hyperapp-context"></script>
</head>
</html>
```

## Usage

### Enable context

In order to enable the context system in your app, don't call Hyperapp's `app` directly. First, wrap it with `withContext`.

```js
import {app as _app} from 'hyperapp'
import {withContext} from 'hyperapp-context'
const app = withContext(_app)

//...

app(state, actions, view, container)
```

### Access context in components

The "context" is a set of data available to components without the need to pass it as props from its parent-container. In order to access context-data, define your components using this signature:

```jsx
const MyComponent = (props, children) => context => (
    <div class={context.foo}>{context.bar}</>
)
```

### Write to the context

In order for a component to have access to data in the context, it must first have been written to the context, by a component higher up in the component-tree. A component can write to the context using the function provided as the second argument after the `context`.

```jsx
const GrandDadComponent = (props, children) => (context, setContext) => {
    setContext({
        foo: 'foo',
        bar: 'bar',
    })
    return (
        <div>
        ...
        </div>
    )
}
```

The example makes `foo` and `bar` available to any decendant in the component tree.

If any components even further up the tree had already defined `foo` or `bar`, this would override those values for any decendants of `GrandDadComponent`, but *siblings* would recieve the original valuues.

#### Define context directly in the view

You can write to the context for your entire app, by setting it in your view. A common use for this is to make `state` and `actions` available to all components.

```js

const view = (state, actions) => (context, setContext) => {
    setContext({state, actions})
    return (
        <main>
            ...
        </main>
    )
}

```

#### Use a component to set context

A technical limitation with the `setContext` function described above, is that it should really only be called once in a component. If called multiple times, only the last call will have an effect.

If you would like to apply different contexts to different branches of descendants in a component, first define a component that can be used to set the context:

```js
const SetContext = (props, children) => (_, setContext) => {
  setContext(props)
  return children
}

```

Now you may use this to define different contexts for different branches inside a single component/view:

```jsx
const view = (state, actions) => (
  <SetContext state={state} actions={foo}>
    <main>
      <section class="toolbar">
        <SetContext section="toolbar">
          <FooButton />
          <BarButton />
        </SetContext>
      </section>
      <section class="main">
        <SetContext section="main">
          <Main />
        </SetContext>
      </section>
    </main>
  </SetContext>
)
```


### Example

This [TodoMVC example](https://codepen.io/zaceno/pen/gvGgQP?editors=0010) makes liberal (extreme, perhaps...) use of context.

## Nestable

Embed hyperapp-apps in your main app, as if they were components. 

Usage is exactly as in https://github.com/zaceno/hyperapp-nestable, except for these two details:

Import using:

```js
import {nestable} from 'hyperapp-context'
```

These nestables are *context enabled*, meaning you get access to the external context in the nestable's view, and can share data from the component with its children, via context:

```js
const MyComponent = nestable(
  //State
  {...},

  //Actions
  {...},

  //View
  (state, actions) => (props, children) => (context, setContext) => {
    setContext({...})
    return children
  }
)
```

## Preprocessing the VDOM

Sometimes you want a component which does not itself add anything to the virtual-dom-tree, but simply modifies it's children in some way, for example, by attaching dom handlers. For this purpose, we export `processor`

```jsx
import {processor} from 'hyperapp-context'

const MyProcessor = processor((props, children, context) => {
  /*
    Here, props will be {foo: 'bar'}
    children will be {nodeName: 'p', attributes:Â {}, children: ['bop']}
    return whatever you want to make of this.
  */
})

const Child = _ => context => <p>bop</p>

...
<MyProcessor foo="bar"><Child></MyProcessor>
...

```

### Decorators

Working directly with vnodes as in the example above is rarely necessary, and a bit rough. Most often what you
want to do is simply to add a few event/lifecycle handers or perhaps a class to the child nodes. To facilitate
this we export `decorator` which lets you define a processing component that does just that:

```jsx
const SelectionDecorator = decorator(({row, col}, {selection}) => ({
    onmousedown: ev => {
        ev.preventDefault(true)
        selection.start({row, col})
    },
    onmouseup: ev => {
        ev.preventDefault(true)
        selection.end({row, col})
    },
    onmouseover: ev => {
        ev.preventDefault(true)
        selection.select({row, col})
    },
    class: selection.isSelected({row, col}) && 'selected'
}))

//...

<SelectionDecorator row={i} col={j}>
<td>{values[i][j]}</td>  
</SelectionDecorator>

//...
```

## Example

This example demonstrates using a nestable as a provider of selection state and actions via the context, and decorating table cells with selection event handlers, so that you can operate on the main state using the selection
data.
